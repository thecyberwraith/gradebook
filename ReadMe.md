# Gradebook

This program is a collection of Python 3 scripts that operate together to
manage grading information shared by Virginia Tech's Hokie Spa, Cengage's
WebAssign, and the Canvas systems.

## Installation

The entry script is currently 'gradebook.py', and it has a Bash header line. To
utilize this script efficiently, add a symbolic link to 'gradebook.py' to your
bin. The 'config.py' file located in the same directory as 'gradebook.py' is
used to configure the program.
